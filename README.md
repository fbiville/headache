# Golang header management

`headache` manages license headers of Go files.

## Example

By default, `headache` looks for a file named `headache.json` in the current directory:

```json
{
  "headerFile": "./license-header.txt",
  "style": "SlashStar",
  "includes": ["**/*.go"],
  "excludes": ["vendor/**/*"],
  "data": {
    "Owner": "The original author or authors"
  }
}
```

`license-header.txt`:
```
Copyright {{.Year}} {{.Owner}}

## Settings

Setting            | Type                    | Definition                                             |
| ---------------- |:----------------------: | -----------------------------------------------------: |
| `headerFile`     | string                  | Path to the parameterized license header. Parameters are referenced with the following syntax: {{.PARAMETER-NAME}}               |
| `style`          | string                  | One of: SlashStar (`/* ... */`), SlashSlash (`// ...`) |
| `includes`       | array of strings        | File globs to include (`*` and `**` are supported)     |
| `excludes`       | array of strings        | File globs to exclude (`*` and `**` are supported)     |
| `data`           | map of string to string | Key-value pairs, matching the parameters used in `headerFile`.<br>Please note that `{{.Year}}` is a reserved parameter and will automatically be computed based on the files versioning information.  |
| `vcs`            | string                  | Versioning system, only `"git"` is supported for now and is the default value.  |
| `vcsRemote`      | string                  | Remote of the current branch, defaults to `"origin"`.  |
| `vcsBranch`      | string                  | Current branch, defaults to `"master"`.                |



## Custom configuration

By default, a file named `headache.json` must be present in the current directory.

Alternatively, the configuration file can be explicitly provided:
```shell
 $ go get -u github.com/fbiville/headache
 $ $(GOBIN)/headache --configuration /path/to/configuration.json
```

All the examples below support that option.

## First run

Normal dry-run/run executions detect only recent changes, based on the versioning
configuration.

When you need to run the first time, you will have to run:
```shell
 $ go get -u github.com/fbiville/headache
 $ $(GOBIN)/headache --dry-run --init
```

And follow the steps just below to read, possibly edit and reinject
the generated dump file.

## Dry run

All you have to do then is to simulate the run:
```shell
 $ go get -u github.com/fbiville/headache
 $ $(GOBIN)/headache --dry-run
```

The command will output the file in which the actual diff summary is appended to.

For instance:
```
See dry-run result in file printed below:
/path/to/headache-dry-runXXX
```

The dump file follows this structure:
```text
file:FILENAME
---
multi-line
colored diff 1
---
file:OTHERFILE
---
multi-line
colored diff 2
---
```

### View the colorized diff summary

If you want to see the dump contents, you can run:
```shell
 $ less -r /path/to/headache-dry-runXXX
```


### List the files

If you want to get a list of the Go files possibly* changed the future
execution, you can run something like:

```
 $ ./headache --dry-run | tail -n 1 | xargs cat | grep '^file:.*\.go' | sed s/file:// | sort
```

_\* the execution may result in no changes at all, or rather, the new written content
will be the same as the previous one_

### Exclude files

Copyright years should only be updated after a
significant change is made (read this
[Stack Overflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2390230/do-copyright-dates-need-to-be-updated)
for more information).

To exclude files from being unnecessarily updated, locate the corresponding line, prefixed by `file:`,
followed by the file name and replace `file:` by `xfile:`.

Then, the modified dump file can be fed back to `headache`, as described just below.

## Run

### From dry-run dump
Once you have successfully run `headache --dry-run` and
possibly edited the dump file (see above to see how), all you have to do then is to run:

```shell
 $ go get -u github.com/fbiville/headache --dump-file /path/to/headache-dry-runXXX
 $ $(GOBIN)/headache
```

This will update only the files for which names are prefixed by `file:`.

### Direct run

All you have to do then is to run:
```shell
 $ go get -u github.com/fbiville/headache
 $ $(GOBIN)/headache
```


## Unsupported

`headache` currently does **not** support text changes other than:

 * parameter value updates
 * comment style changes

# Header management

`headache` manages license headers.
It is biased towards Golang but should work on any other language (provided a compatible code comment style is implemented).

## Build status

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fbiville/headache.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/fbiville/headache)

## Quick start

By default, `headache` looks for a configuration file named `headache.json` in the directory in which it is invoked:

```json
{
  "headerFile": "./license-header.txt",
  "style": "SlashStar",
  "includes": ["**/*.go"],
  "excludes": ["vendor/**/*"],
  "data": {
    "Owner": "The original author or authors"
  }
}
```

`license-header.txt` (note the absence of `YearRange` parameter in the configuration file):
```
Copyright {{.YearRange}} {{.Owner}}

```

### Run

All you have to do then is:
```shell
 $ go get -u github.com/fbiville/headache
 $ $(GOBIN)/headache
```

As a result, source files will be changed and `.headache-run` will be generated to keep track of `headache` last execution.
This file must be versioned along with the source file changes.

### Run with custom configuration

Alternatively, the configuration file can be explicitly provided:
```shell
 $ go get -u github.com/fbiville/headache
 $ $(GOBIN)/headache --configuration /path/to/configuration.json
```

## Reference documentation

### Approach

`headache` approach to copyright is well explained in [this stackoverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/2391555/277128), 
read it first!

Now that you read this, here are two important points:

 - Copyright years have to be updated when a significant change occurs.
 
There is, to the author knowledge, no automatic solution to distinguish a trivial change from a significant one.

Based on this premise, `headache` will process all files matching the configuration and that have been changed since its last execution.
`headache` will then compute the copyright year, file by file, from their available versioning information (typically by retrieving the relevant dates from Git commits).

**It is up to the project maintainer to discard the generated changes if they are not relevant.**

 - > The [first] date on the [copyright] notice establishes how far back the claim is made.
 
This claim could predate any commit associated to the file (imagine a file copied from project to project for years).

`headache` will never overwrite the start date of the copyright year if it finds one, if and only if that date occurs earlier than the first commit date of the file.

### Configuration

`headache` relies on the emerging [JSON Schema standard](https://json-schema.org/) to validate its configuration.
`headache` schema is defined [here](https://fbiville.github.io/headache/schema.json).

In layman's terms, here are all the possible settings:

Setting            | Type                    | Definition                                             |
| ---------------- |:----------------------: | -----------------------------------------------------: |
| `headerFile`     | string                  | **[required]** Path to the parameterized license header. Parameters are referenced with the following syntax: {{.PARAMETER-NAME}}               |
| `style`          | string                  | **[required]** See all the possible names [here](https://fbiville.github.io/headache/schema.json) |
| `includes`       | array of strings        | **[required, min size=1]** File globs to include (`*` and `**` are supported)     |
| `excludes`       | array of strings        | File globs to exclude (`*` and `**` are supported)     |
| `data`           | map of string to string | Key-value pairs, matching the parameters used in `headerFile` except for the reserved parameters (see below section).


#### Reserved parameters

 - `{{.YearRange}}` (formerly `{{.Year}}`) is automatically substituted with either:
     - a single year if both years in the range are the same
     - a year range with the earliest commit's year* and latest commit's year
 - `{{.StartYear}}` is substituted with the earliest commit's year
 - `{{.EndYear}}` is substituted with the latest commit's year
 
As explained earlier, if a file specifies a start date in its header that is earlier than any commit's year, then that
date is preserved.

If you want to avoid copyright dates like `2019-2019`, then rely on `{{.YearRange}}`.
If you need something like `2018-present`, then use `{{.StartYear}}-present` instead.
